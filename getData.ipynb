    "This is the \"spiderweb\" match collection idea that is often suggested on the Riot API\n",
    "forums as the best way to collect a large number of matches.\n",
    "It works as follows:\n",
    "Given a match, we pull all the summoners in that match. Then for each of those summoners,\n",
    "we collect their games via the matchlist endpoint, and then pull down all of their matches\n",
    "and save them to a database. In Cassiopeia, if you have set up your SQLAlchemy databse then\n",
    "every match (and in fact every summoner, etc.) gets stored in your database automatically.\n",
    "This makes it reasonably easy to pull matches and create a large databse.\n",
    "The algorithm will simply keep doing this until you, the user, stop it. Make sure you keep an\n",
    "eye on how large your database is getting! You may want to put a conditional break statement\n",
    "somewhere in the code.\n",
    "In order for the algorithm to start, we need a match or a summoner to start the lookup. We\n",
    "first pull the Master tier and use those summoners as seed data. For the rest of the match\n",
